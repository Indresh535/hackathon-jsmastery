Setting up a reverse proxy allows you to host the same application on multiple domains without duplicating your codebase. This ensures that all traffic to https://newdomain.com is routed to the application hosted at https://originaldomain.com, and the user remains unaware of the original domain.

Here’s a detailed step-by-step guide to setting up a reverse proxy using IIS (commonly used in ASP.NET environments):

1. Set Up the New Domain in DNS
Update your DNS configuration to point the newdomain.com to the server where you will configure the reverse proxy.
Ensure the A or CNAME records are set up for the domain and any subdomains.
2. Install and Configure IIS on the Reverse Proxy Server
Ensure IIS is installed on the server hosting newdomain.com.

Install IIS URL Rewrite and ARR Modules
Install Application Request Routing (ARR):

ARR is used for routing requests to other servers.
Download and install ARR from Microsoft’s site.
Install URL Rewrite Module:

This module helps rewrite incoming URLs and forward them to another server.
3. Set Up a New IIS Site for the New Domain
Open IIS Manager.
Right-click on Sites and select Add Website.
Configure the following:
Site Name: NewDomainSite
Physical Path: Select an empty folder (e.g., C:\inetpub\NewDomainSite).
Binding:
Type: https
Hostname: newdomain.com
Ensure you have an SSL certificate installed for newdomain.com.
4. Configure Reverse Proxy in IIS
Select the site for newdomain.com in IIS Manager.
Double-click Application Request Routing Cache.
On the right-hand pane, click Server Proxy Settings and:
Enable Proxy by checking Enable Proxy.
Click Apply.
Set Up URL Rewrite Rules
Double-click URL Rewrite for the site.
Click Add Rules in the right pane.
Select Reverse Proxy.
Enter the target (original) domain in the Inbound Rules:
Target URL: https://originaldomain.com
Ensure the rule forwards all requests to https://originaldomain.com.
Save the settings.
5. Mask the Original Domain
To ensure users only see the new domain (https://newdomain.com) in their browser:

The reverse proxy must handle all responses.
Ensure there are no redirects in the backend that point to originaldomain.com.
6. Test the Reverse Proxy
Open a browser and navigate to https://newdomain.com.
Confirm that:
The content of https://originaldomain.com is displayed.
The browser address bar shows https://newdomain.com.
7. Secure the Communication
To ensure secure and encrypted communication:

Both newdomain.com and originaldomain.com must have valid SSL certificates.
Configure IIS to enforce HTTPS-only communication.
8. Optional: Optimize for Performance
Enable caching in the ARR settings to improve performance.
Monitor the reverse proxy logs to identify potential bottlenecks.
Example Configuration:
Request URL (User): https://newdomain.com/home
Forwarded URL: https://originaldomain.com/home
Troubleshooting
If the new domain does not load:
Verify the DNS and binding configuration in IIS.
Check for firewalls blocking the traffic between the proxy server and the original domain.
If the original domain appears in the browser:
Ensure there are no absolute redirects in the original application.

Web Server vs. Application Server: Explained
Both web servers and application servers are essential components in a web-based infrastructure, but they serve distinct roles in handling web requests and serving content. Here's a breakdown of their differences, functions, and how they work together.

Web Server
Definition:
A web server is a software that serves static content to clients (usually web browsers) over HTTP/HTTPS. It is primarily responsible for handling requests for static resources like HTML, CSS, JavaScript files, and images.

Primary Function:
The main job of a web server is to accept incoming HTTP requests, process them, and return an HTTP response. This response usually contains static resources like HTML pages, images, or files. The web server doesn’t perform any heavy computations or logic; it simply serves what it has in its file system or from a network resource.

Key Functions:
Serving Static Content: A web server serves files such as HTML, images (JPEG, PNG), CSS, JavaScript, and videos to the browser.
Request Handling: It handles HTTP(S) requests from clients (e.g., web browsers) and returns appropriate responses (e.g., HTML pages or files).
Load Balancing: In some cases, web servers can distribute incoming requests to multiple application servers for load balancing.
SSL Termination: Web servers can handle the encryption and decryption of traffic over HTTPS (SSL/TLS).
Reverse Proxy: A web server can forward requests to an application server, acting as a reverse proxy.
Common Examples:
Apache HTTP Server (Apache)
Nginx
Microsoft IIS (Internet Information Services)
When to Use a Web Server:
When you need to serve static content like HTML, CSS, images, or files.
If you have a small-scale application with minimal dynamic content or a setup where the dynamic content is handled by a separate service.
Application Server
Definition:
An application server is a more advanced type of server that provides an environment where applications can run, typically offering more complex functionalities like handling dynamic content, processing business logic, and managing database connections.

Primary Function:
An application server hosts and runs server-side applications, which often involve logic and interactions with databases or other services. It serves dynamic content and provides a platform for application execution, such as running Java or .NET applications.

Key Functions:
Handling Dynamic Content: It processes dynamic requests, such as those involving database interactions, user authentication, or business logic, and returns dynamic content like HTML pages generated on the fly.
Business Logic Execution: It executes the backend code (e.g., Java servlets, PHP, .NET applications) that makes decisions or manipulates data.
Database Connections: It often manages connections to databases and can handle data storage, queries, and transactions.
Session Management: Application servers manage user sessions, authentication, and authorization.
Transaction Management: They can handle transactions to ensure data consistency in database operations (important in enterprise applications).
Middleware Services: Many application servers provide middleware services like messaging, queuing, or object handling (e.g., Java EE, .NET).
Common Examples:
Apache Tomcat (for Java-based applications)
WildFly (formerly JBoss) (Java EE applications)
Microsoft IIS with .NET Framework (for .NET applications)
GlassFish (Java EE server)
Node.js (for running JavaScript-based applications)
Ruby on Rails (Ruby application server)
When to Use an Application Server:
When you need to run server-side applications with dynamic content.
If you have complex business logic, database interaction, or enterprise-level needs.
When you're handling more than just serving static files, and you need to support complex user interactions (e.g., handling e-commerce transactions, user authentication, data processing).
Key Differences Between Web Server and Application Server
Aspect	Web Server	Application Server
Purpose	Serves static content (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images)	Runs dynamic applications and handles business logic
Content Handling	Primarily serves static files and resources	Handles dynamic content generation and business logic
Protocols	Primarily HTTP/HTTPS	HTTP, HTTPS, as well as other protocols (e.g., SOAP, JMS)
Types of Content	Static content (HTML, images, CSS, etc.)	Dynamic content (database queries, session management, etc.)
Examples	Apache HTTP Server, Nginx, IIS	Apache Tomcat, JBoss, WildFly, GlassFish, Node.js
Key Focus	Request routing and static content delivery	Application execution, business logic, and transaction management
Language Support	Primarily serves files (HTML, JS, images)	Supports various application frameworks (Java, .NET, PHP, etc.)
Performance	Faster for static content, less resource-intensive	More resource-intensive due to dynamic content generation








It sounds like you've developed an application that directly connects to a database from your web application, bypassing the use of APIs or web services for communication between the web front-end and the database. While this approach may work for smaller-scale applications or low user loads, there are several considerations and potential issues that can arise when handling larger user loads (like the 50k user load you're expecting). Let's go over some important aspects:

1. Direct Database Connection from the Web Application:
What it means: In this architecture, your web application communicates directly with the database, issuing queries directly from the front-end or backend to interact with the data (e.g., fetching records, updating records, etc.). There’s no intermediary layer like an API or web service to manage requests.
Risks:
Security: Exposing direct database connections to the web application can create security risks, such as SQL injection, unauthorized data access, or exposing sensitive database credentials.
Scalability: Directly querying the database for 50,000 concurrent users can put a significant strain on the database, especially if the queries are not optimized or if your database cannot handle such load effectively.
Maintainability: Without an API layer to separate the business logic from the data layer, future changes to the database schema or business logic could become more difficult to manage. APIs abstract the complexity, making it easier to update the back-end without affecting the front-end.
Load Balancing: As your user base grows, managing concurrent database connections becomes a challenge. Traditional database setups might struggle with handling a large number of simultaneous connections.
2. Concerns with 50,000 User Load:
Database Performance: A direct connection approach without caching or optimization can lead to database bottlenecks. High user loads can overwhelm the database with concurrent requests, leading to slow performance, timeouts, or crashes. You may encounter:
Connection limits: Databases typically have a limit on how many concurrent connections they can handle. If each user opens a new connection to the database, this can exhaust the available connections.
Query performance: If your queries aren’t optimized (e.g., missing indexes, inefficient joins), they could perform poorly under load.
Locking issues: High concurrent writes/updates to the database can lead to locking issues, where transactions wait for others to complete, slowing down performance.
Network Latency: Depending on your database’s location and the way your web app interacts with it, network latency could become an issue as the number of requests grows.
3. Advantages of APIs and Web Services in Scalability:
To handle a large user load like 50,000 users, it is generally recommended to use APIs or web services between the application and the database. Here’s why:

Separation of Concerns: APIs abstract the business logic and data access layer, improving code maintainability. Changes to the database schema or logic can be isolated from the client-facing code.
Security: APIs can provide secure access to the database by controlling and validating requests (e.g., authentication, authorization). Direct database access from the client-side can expose sensitive data and credentials.
Load Balancing: APIs can be scaled horizontally (e.g., load-balanced across multiple application servers) and optimized for high performance. They can also manage caching mechanisms, ensuring that not every request hits the database.
Database Connection Pooling: APIs can use database connection pools to manage connections efficiently. Instead of each user creating a new database connection, the API can reuse existing connections, reducing overhead and improving performance.
Caching: APIs can implement caching mechanisms (e.g., in-memory caches like Redis or Memcached) to reduce database load by serving frequently requested data without querying the database every time.
Rate Limiting and Throttling: APIs can implement rate limiting to prevent excessive database queries from overloading your infrastructure.
4. Suggested Improvements for Handling 50k Users:
If you still want to continue with the direct database connection approach, you might want to consider the following optimizations:

Database Connection Pooling: Ensure that your web application uses connection pooling to limit the number of concurrent connections to the database. This will help to manage resources more efficiently.
Optimized Queries and Indexing: Review and optimize your database queries to ensure they are efficient, and ensure that the database tables have appropriate indexes for fast lookups.
Load Balancing: Consider implementing load balancing for your database to distribute queries across multiple database instances (read replicas for read-heavy workloads).
Caching: Implement caching to reduce the number of database queries for frequently accessed data. This could include page caching or data-level caching for specific queries.
5. Consider Using Web Services or APIs:
Even if you're not using them now, you may want to consider adopting APIs or web services for future scalability and better handling of high user loads. This will allow for:

Better management of business logic.
More control over database access through API authentication, rate limiting, and optimization techniques.
Greater flexibility in handling the growing needs of your app as it scales to thousands or millions of users.
Conclusion:
While connecting directly to the database may work for small-scale applications, it’s not an ideal solution for handling large user loads (like 50,000 users) due to scalability, performance, and security concerns. To future-proof your application, consider introducing APIs or web services between the front-end and the database. This approach will allow you to better manage traffic, optimize performance, and improve maintainability as your app grows.

Do You Still Need Models for MySQL/ClickHouse?
For MySQL: Yes, when using an ORM like Sequelize or TypeORM, you will define models that map to your database tables. These models help to abstract away the raw SQL queries, provide validation, and allow for easier interaction with the database.

For ClickHouse: No, you don’t necessarily need to create models in the same way. Since ClickHouse doesn't have an ORM and you're mostly working with raw SQL queries, you will directly interact with tables and manage the results in your code.

When Do You Need Models?
MySQL: Models are needed when using an ORM (Sequelize, TypeORM) because these libraries abstract the SQL and provide a higher-level API to interact with the database.
ClickHouse: Models aren’t required because you're likely using raw SQL queries, but you can implement a "model-like" abstraction if you want to organize your queries and data management.
In summary:

MySQL: You will define models if you're using an ORM.
ClickHouse: You don't need models (but can create them for structure), as you're typically dealing with raw SQL queries.
